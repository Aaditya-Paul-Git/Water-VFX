# How It Works

## Underwater Animation Effect

This script creates a beautiful underwater effect with spinning fish, floating bubbles, and smooth animations. It's perfect for making an underwater scene come to life in Roblox!

## What It Does

- **Adds Objects**: Fish, bubbles, and other underwater objects appear randomly.
- **Smooth Movement**: The objects spin around in circles (orbits) and some float up and down like bubbles.
- **Random Sizes & Colors**: Each object has a random size and color to make the scene look unique and lively.
- **Fade-In Effect**: New objects appear smoothly by fading in.

## How It Works

1. **Create Objects**: The script picks random fish or bubble templates and makes copies (clones) of them.
2. **Orbit Movement**: Each object moves in a circle around a central point, like planets orbiting the sun.
3. **Floating Bubbles**: Some objects, like bubbles, move up and down gently to look natural.
4. **Continuous Animation**: The script updates the positions and rotations of the objects in real-time to keep the animation running smoothly.

## Features

- Fish and bubbles spin and float around dynamically.
- Randomized sizes and colors for variety.
- Smooth transitions with fade-in effects.
- Realistic floating and orbiting movement.
